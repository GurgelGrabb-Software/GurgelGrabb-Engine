# GurgelGrabb Engine (GGE)

## What is GGE?
**GGE** is the spiritual successor of **SS2** (*SpelSylt 2D*). A multi-platform game engine built in C++ using OpenGL.  

### Current State of Development
**GGE** is currently in its early days of implementation.  
We're yet to decide on any core structures with regards to projects, types and general software layout.  


## Third Party
The following third party libraries enable **GGE**s existance

* [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) - OpenGL loader
* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) - OpenGL interfacing
* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) - Math types for OpenGL
* [fmtlib](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) - String formatting (similar to C++20 format)
* [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb) - stb_image for loading image files, stb_image_write for writing images to disk
